--> Dynamic memory allocation is happening in the interrupt which not thread safe with C standar libraries of malloc(). Need to change everything into static
--> After dynamic memory allocation, Ram may unable to find where free space is there. 
--> Varibles are in the function some are in the loop with another function which is not recommended.
--> Check abot static keyword and use it on required places.
--> Check about memory leaks or not freeing places.

--> Some combination of the commands are working which are wrong. Need to update is_command_valid() funciton to it's optimum
	'HOME '
	'HOME \n' -> Need to make it react to the \r command 
	'G90 Z10 F0' -> stucking the motor into the loop of run without speed
	'G90 Z10 ' -> Need to take care of currently it taking reference of previous speed of the command
	
--> Check time is taking to complete the interrut task and it should be in the micro seconds. Based on that optimize the functions
